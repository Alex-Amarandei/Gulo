# 🌟 Gulo

## ❓ What is Gulo?

Gulo is a tool designed to help streamline the adoption of Sablier. It's a free-to-use app that provides better visibility into your Sablier Stream Portfolio.

In the near future, Gulo will evolve into a one-stop shop for all things Sablier finance! Whether it's analytics, reporting, or just a quick overview, you'll be able to do everything here.

Gulo is a one-dev project in continuous development and is free to use. Your support is appreciated if you find it helpful! 🫡

## 👥 Who is Gulo for?

If you are a Sablier user with more than one stream, you are in the right place! Using Gulo is as simple as connecting your wallet—Gulo takes care of the rest!

## 💡 What can you do with Gulo?

Currently, the main feature is calculating the total amount of funds available for withdrawal from your Sablier Stream Portfolio at any given moment. However, many exciting features will be shipped in the coming weeks! Keep an eye out 😉

## 🌱 Why was Gulo created?

The Sablier Team has revolutionized the concept of money streaming in the Ethereum Ecosystem. Gulo represents a helping hand from an eager supporter aspiring to become a full-time Web3 builder. This project is my first endeavor in this direction.
